        <p class="mt-6 max-w-3xl">
          The TIOBE Index is a widely recognized ranking that measures the
          popularity of programming languages. Established in 2001, its primary
          purpose is to provide insights into the trends and shifts in
          programming language usage over time.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6 max-w-3xl">
          The TIOBE Index evaluates programming languages based on the number of
          skilled engineers, courses, and third-party vendors associated with
          each language. It aggregates data from various sources, including
          search engines, online forums, and social media platforms, to assess
          the frequency of language mentions and discussions. This comprehensive
          approach ensures that the rankings reflect real-world usage and
          interest.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-6 max-w-3xl">
          The index is updated monthly, allowing it to capture the dynamic
          nature of the programming landscape. Factors influencing the rankings
          include the number of search queries related to each language, the
          volume of tutorials and educational content available, and the overall
          community engagement surrounding the language. By providing a snapshot
          of programming language popularity, the TIOBE Index helps stakeholders
          make informed decisions about technology adoption and career
          development in the ever-evolving field of software development.

                  Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose
                  programming language.It was designed with an emphasis on

                  is an object, including primitive data types.It was developed
                  in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.. Ruby
                  is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and

                  Prolog is a logic programming language. It has important role
                  in artificial intelligence. Unlike many other programming
                  languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative
                  programming language. In prolog, logic is expressed as
                  relations (called as Facts and Rules). Core heart of prolog
                  lies at the logic being applied.

                  A list is a collection of items, not necessarily homogeneous.
                  In Prolog, lists are inbuilt data structures. Lists can be
                  used to represent sets, stacks, queues, linked lists, and
